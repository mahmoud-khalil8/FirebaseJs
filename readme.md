## Real-time Database
Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows real-time data synchronization across clients.
It uses a JSON-like data structure, making it easy to store and retrieve data in real-time.
The database automatically handles data synchronization and provides offline capabilities, enabling your app to work seamlessly even when the device is offline.
Firebase Realtime Database supports listeners for real-time data changes, allowing you to update the UI automatically whenever the data changes.
It also provides powerful querying capabilities, allowing you to filter, order, and limit data retrieval based on specific criteria.
